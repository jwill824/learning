# Git and GitHub Fundamentals

## Git Version Control Basics

### What is Version Control?

Version Control System (VCS) is a set of tools that tracks changes in files and enables:

- Version history tracking and retrieval
- Collaborative work without interference
- Change documentation and messaging
- Branch creation for experimental features
- Version tagging (e.g., for releases)

## GitHub Platform Overview

Git is an open-source, distributed VCS created by Linus Torvalds that offers:

- Fast and scalable performance
- Local and server-side repository copies
- Offline work capability
- Robust backup system

## Key Git Terminology

- Working Tree & Repository
    
    ‚Ä¢ Working Tree: Project's directory structure with files
    ‚Ä¢ Repository (repo): Directory containing project history and metadata
    
- Core Concepts
    
    ‚Ä¢ Hash: Digital fingerprint of file contents
    ‚Ä¢ Objects: Blobs (files), Trees (directories), Commits (versions), Tags (named points)
    ‚Ä¢ Branch: Named series of commits
    ‚Ä¢ Remote: Reference to external Git repository
    

## Git vs GitHub

While Git is the version control system, GitHub is a cloud platform that:

- Hosts Git repositories
- Provides collaboration tools (Issues, Pull requests)
- Offers project management features
- Enables team discussions and notifications
- Includes automation through GitHub Actions

# Security and Code Quality

## Configure code scanning on GitHub

### What is Code Scanning?

Code scanning is a security feature that uses CodeQL to analyze GitHub repositories for vulnerabilities and coding errors. Its advanced analysis capabilities include:

- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS attacks, authentication issues)
- Coding errors (memory leaks, null pointer exceptions)
- Available for all public repositories and private repositories with GitHub Advanced Security license

### Key Features

- Real-time alerts in repository's Security tab with detailed vulnerability information
- Automated vulnerability detection using CodeQL's semantic analysis
- Scheduled or event-triggered scans (configurable for push, pull request, or cron events)
- Prevention of new code problems through pre-merge checks

### CodeQL Overview

CodeQL is GitHub's code analysis engine that:

- Treats code as data for analysis using semantic understanding
- Generates a queryable database representing the entire codebase structure
- Runs complex security queries to identify potential vulnerabilities and anti-patterns

### Supported Languages

- C/C++ (including preprocessor directives and macros)
- C# (.NET Framework and .NET Core)
- Go (including Go modules)
- Java/Kotlin (Android and enterprise applications)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js and browser-based)
- Python (2.7 and 3.x versions)
- Ruby (Rails and standalone applications)
- Swift (iOS and macOS applications)

### Setup Options

Three main ways to implement CodeQL analysis, each with specific use cases:

- **Default Setup:** Quick configuration with automated language detection and query selection, ideal for standard projects
- **Advanced Setup:** Customizable workflow file using github/codeql-action, recommended for complex scanning requirements
- **External CI System:** Direct CLI implementation with result uploads to GitHub, suitable for custom CI/CD pipelines

### Implementation Steps

1. Navigate to repository's main page (ensure proper access permissions)
2. Select Security tab (requires GitHub Advanced Security enabled)
3. Click "Set up code scanning" (must have write permissions)
4. Choose Default setup (recommended for initial configuration)
5. Review and customize options if needed (languages, schedule, triggers)
6. Enable CodeQL (initiates first analysis scan)

### Important Notes

- Triggers on pull requests and pushes to protected branches (configurable via workflow)
- Affects monthly billing minutes for GitHub Actions (consider usage limits)
- Free for public repositories and self-hosted runners (unlimited scans)
- Usage limits apply for private repositories based on account type (Enterprise vs Team)

### Implementing Third-Party Code Scanning

- Does the project have a code of conduct?
- Does the project have clear Contributing Guidelines?
</aside>

### Making Your First Contribution

Before diving into code changes, it's crucial to follow proper communication and workflow practices when contributing to open source projects.

#### Communication Best Practices

- **Start with clear communication:** Always discuss your intended contribution before starting work
- **Be patient and open-minded:** Maintainers have other commitments and may not respond immediately
- **Keep discussions public:** Use issue trackers and pull request comments rather than private messages

#### Contribution Workflow

- **Check issue status:** Verify that no one else is working on the issue you're interested in
- **Follow templates:** Use provided issue and pull request templates when available
- **Create focused changes:** Keep pull requests small and focused on a single issue
- **Test your changes:** Ensure all status checks pass before requesting review

<aside>
**Pro tip**

When creating your first pull request, look for issues labeled with `good-first-issue` or `beginner-friendly`. These are specifically chosen by maintainers as suitable entry points for new contributors.

</aside>

### Pull Request Best Practices

#### Writing Effective Commit Messages

- **Use the imperative mood:** Complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will..."
- **Keep it concise:** Limit subject lines to 50 characters and start with a capital letter
- **Focus on why, not how:** Explain the motivation and contrast with previous behavior
- **Submit small changes:** Make focused, isolated commits to increase merge likelihood

#### Pull Request Details

- **Add appropriate reviewers and assignees:** Select team members when familiar with project structure
- **Use descriptive labels:** Apply relevant labels like "Bug", "Documentation", or "Enhancement"
- **Link related issues:** Connect PRs to corresponding issues they might resolve
- **Manage notifications:** Choose appropriate notification settings based on involvement level

<aside>
**Accessibility Tip**

When describing UI interactions in documentation or comments, use generic verbs that work with any input method. For example, use "select" instead of "click" or "swipe" to be inclusive of all users regardless of their input method.

</aside>

### **How to maintain a secure GitHub repository**

Maintaining a secure GitHub repository is crucial for protecting your code, sensitive data, and ensuring the integrity of your development process. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of key security aspects:

#### Core Security Strategy

- **Security from the Start:** Security must be integrated into every stage of development, not added as an afterthought
- **Shift Left Approach:** Moving security testing earlier in the development cycle helps catch issues sooner and reduces overall development time
- **Developer-Centric Security:** Making security tools and feedback accessible where developers work

#### Essential Security Features

- **Security Tab:** Central hub for managing repository security features
- **Security Policies:** Implemented via [SECURITY.md](http://SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
- **Dependabot Alerts:** Automated notifications for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Scanning:** Helps identify and fix code vulnerabilities

#### Protection Mechanisms

- **.gitignore Implementation:** Prevents sensitive files from being committed
- **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforces workflow requirements and code review processes
- **CODEOWNERS:** Ensures appropriate review of changes by designated team members

<aside>
**Key Takeaway:** Security is an ongoing process that requires both tools and practices working together. It's essential to implement multiple layers of protection while maintaining developer productivity.

</aside>

### Automated Security Features

GitHub provides several automated security features to help maintain repository security:

#### Dependency Management

- **Repository Dependency Graphs:** Automatically scan package manifests to track all project dependencies recursively
- **Dependabot Alerts:** Monitor dependency graphs and alert when security vulnerabilities are discovered
- **Automated Updates:** Dependabot can automatically create pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies

#### Code Analysis

- **Code Scanning:** Analyzes code for security vulnerabilities and errors using CodeQL
- **Custom Queries:** Supports custom CodeQL queries and community-maintained query sets
- **Secret Scanning:** Detects and prevents exposure of credentials and sensitive data in repositories

<aside>
**Pro Tip:** Enable these automated security features in your repository's Security tab to create a robust, automated security pipeline that helps catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.

</aside>

## Authenticate and authorize user identities on GitHub

### User Identity and Access Management

**Key Points:**

- Access to company data and applications starts with user authentication.
- Individual accounts can log in with a username and password, but enabling 2FA is strongly recommended for better security.
- Balancing ease of use with secure authorization processes is critical.
- Authentication setup is essential for secure enterprise software development.

**Tools:** Use an identity provider (IdP) to enhance GitHub's authentication capabilities.

### Organization Management through SAML SSO

**Key Features:**

- SAML SSO allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.
- IdP authenticates users and provides access to services like GitHub.
- Enterprise Administrators manage user access, permissions, audits, and export user data if needed.

**Supported SAML Providers:**

- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Okta
- OneLogin
- PingOne
- Shibboleth

**Additional Notes:** GitHub supports any IdP that implements the SAML 2.0 standard, albeit with limited support.

### Repository Access in Organizations

**Public, Private, and Internal Repositories:**

- Public - Accessible to everyone.
- Private - Accessible only to the creator and shared users.
- Internal - Accessible to organization members only.
- Organizations can group users based on division or project needs.

### User Authentication

**SAML SSO:**

- An Admin must connect GitHub to an IdP for SAML SSO.
- Users authenticate via the IdP, then access GitHub resources.
- Admins can enforce SAML SSO to ensure all members authenticate through the IdP.

**2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):**

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a critical security measure for protecting user accounts. It requires a username and password plus a second authentication method, providing an added layer of security.

| Authentication Methods | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Security Keys | The most secure option, offering phishing-resistant protection and requiring a physical key. |
| TOTP Apps | Cloud-based, reliable globally, and supports secure code backups. |
| SMS | A fallback option with limited support, relying on access to the user's mobile device. |

**Audit 2FA Compliance:**

- Admins can view who enabled 2FA via the "People" tab in the organization settings.
- Non-compliant users lose access but communication is needed to inform them.

Revoking access for non-compliant users ensures the security of organizational resources. Administrators must communicate these changes via email or other methods.

### User Authorization

**Overview:**

- User authorization follows authentication and ensures secure access to GitHub organization resources.
- After authenticating via an IdP, users authorize personal access tokens, SSH keys, or OAuth Apps to access organizational data.

**Authorization with SAML SSO:**

- SAML SSO allows administrators to control access to repositories, issues, and pull requests.
- SCIM integration enables automated synchronization of user identity information between the IdP and GitHub, streamlining user lifecycle management.
- Admins can provision and deprovision users automatically, reducing manual errors and enhancing security.

**Practical Applications:**

- Admins can review and manage linked SAML identities, active sessions, and authorized credentials.
- Using SCIM ensures that off-boarding processes are automated when users leave an organization.

**Supported Identity Providers:**

| Provider | SCIM Support |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Entra ID | Supported |
| Okta | Supported |
| OneLogin | Supported |
| Custom Configurations | Limited or no technical support from GitHub. |

### Team Synchronization Summary

Team synchronization allows organizations to manage team membership in GitHub through their identity providers (IdPs) such as Microsoft Entra ID or Okta. This feature reflects changes made in IdP groups directly on GitHub, eliminating the need for manual updates or custom scripts.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sync Users | Add or remove users from GitHub teams to match changes in Active Directory groups. |
| Sync on New Team | Automatically synchronize users when a new team is created. |
| Custom Team/Group Maps | Automatically match team names to group names, or define custom mappings using`syncmap.yml`. |
| Dynamic Config | Use a`settings`file to configure Active Directory and GitHub settings. |

To enable synchronization, administrators must configure SAML SSO and SCIM through their IdP. This process streamlines administrative tasks like onboarding, permission updates, and access revocation.

### Enterprise Managed Users

Enterprise Managed Users provide centralized control for enterprise accounts. All members are managed through the IdP, restricting their accounts to the enterprise environment. This ensures that managed accounts cannot interact outside their organization, enhancing security and management efficiency.

### Usage Limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum GitHub team members | 5,000 |
| Maximum GitHub organization members | 10,000 |
| Maximum GitHub organization teams | 1,500 |

### Supported IdPs for Team Synchronization

Only Microsoft Entra ID and Okta are supported for enabling team synchronization. Each IdP requires specific configurations:

| IdP | Setup Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Entra ID | Enable "automatic user account provisioning" and provide permissions to read profiles and directory data. |
| Okta | Enable SAML SSO and SCIM, provide the tenant URL, and configure an SSWS token with appropriate permissions.
